# Socket Chat
Chat application to understand the working of websockets.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
This project assumes you are familiar with NodeJS (`9.11.1`) and NPM (`5.6.0`), and have those installed. Client side you would need a browser that supports `JS ES6 Modules` and `WebSocket`.

### Code style
All JS should conform to the eslint config thats included. Please make sure ESlint is functional in your code editor and the supplied config is being used.

### Installing and running
Getting the application running is straightforward. First make sure you have installed all modules:
```
npm install
```

Afterwards you can start the app by using:
```
npm start
```

Additionally, you can watch the project by using, assuming you have nodemon (`1.12.1`) installed:
```
npm run watch
```
